<h1>What is it for?</h1>

<p>To join all meshes inside collection into single mesh (also recursive) in <strong>non-destructive</strong> way.</p>
<p>This might be useful for anyone who wants to optimize build from mesh tiles.</p>

<h1>How to use it?</h1>

<p>Right-click, collection in outliner (scene panel). You should see two options, at the end of the menu context list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Join</li>
  <li>Join Recursive</li>
</ul>

<p>Join - joins all meshes assigned to selected collection.</p>
<p>Join Recursive - joins all meshes assigned to selected collection <strong>AND</strong> all meshes in descendant collections.</p>
